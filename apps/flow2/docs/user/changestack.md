# Changing the Stack

[Project Stacks](concepts.md#project-stack) define various aspects of how the project is run - including the version of Node-RED being used.

FlowForge allows you to change the stack a project is using - providing a way
to upgrade Node-RED.

**Note:** Stacks are created by Administrators and made available to the teams
and users of the platform.

When an Administrator creates a new version
of a Stack your project is using, the platform will notify you that there is a
new version available.


To change a project's stack:

1. Go to the project's page and select **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Select the **Danger** section in the side menu
3. Click the **Change Project Stack** button
4. You will be prompted to select the new stack for the project.
5. Click **Change Stack**

Your project will now be restart on the new stack.

**Note:** Changing the stack causes the project to be stopped and restarted. This
will require a short downtime of the project flows.
