This internal module provides some common utilities for tests in the FlowForge
repository.

Providing them as in 'internal' module like this allows them to be required from
any file lower in the directory structure, without that file needing to get the
relative path right.

### `require('flowforge-test-utils')`

The main exported code provides utility functions for tests to load resources
from the core code base without them needing to know their own position in the
file structure.

This makes it easier to move tests around with having to edit relative paths
from the test case to the src code.

Any file under the `test` directory of the repo can do:

```
// Load the test util module
const FF_UTIL = require('flowforge-test-utils')

// Load an arbitrary file from the src tree
const { Roles } = FF_UTIL.require('forge/lib/roles')
```

This module provides two functions

 - `require` - load a file from the source tree
 - `resolve` - get the full path to a file in the source tree

### `require('flowforge-test-utils/forge/postoffice/localTransport')`

This module provides an email transport that can be used for local testing - removing
the need for the tests to rely on an external SMTP server.
