# FlowForge

FlowForge is an open-source low-code platform based on the OpenJS Foundation Node-RED
project. It provides the tools you need to run and manage multiple Node-RED instances
in your own environment. It was created to make it easier to run Node-RED at scale while keeping DevOps to a minimum.

* FlowForge gives a clear overview of all your projects in one easy to use dashboard.

* FlowForge provides one-click deployment capability, with version control, to thousands of devices
